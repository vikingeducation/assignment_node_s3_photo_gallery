# Node AWS S3 Photo Gallery

## Introduction
In this assignment I implemented a simple photo gallery which uploads photos to AWS' S3 Service.

## Technologies Used
AWS, S3, Node, Express, MongoDB

## Getting Started
To set this project up on your own local host, simply clone the repository, install the dependencies. If you have an Amazon AWS account with S3 available, you can enter your credentials into a .env file at the root directory in the following manner:

```
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=*YOUR_ACCESS_KEY*
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=*YOUR_SECRET_KEY*
AWS_S3_BUCKET=*YOUR_BUCKET_NAME*
```

Finally, fire up the server with `yarn start`/`npm start`.
